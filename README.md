<h5 align="center">‚≠ê Hi! I'm a 17-year-old frontend developer. I work with HTML, CSS, React, React Native, Redux, and SQL. I also write scripts for RAGE:MP.
In addition, I'm familiar with JavaScript, TypeScript, Git, REST APIs, and basic UI/UX principles. I have experience building responsive and cross-browser interfaces, and have worked with version control systems and CI/CD pipelines. I'm constantly learning and striving to grow as a professional. </h5>
